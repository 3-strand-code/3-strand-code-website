                Front End Web Development

            </h2>


            <p>
                In loose terms, front end web development encompasses “building the part of the web people see and use.”
                Front end development often includes elements of user interface design (UI) and user experience design
                (UX), though these are separate areas of expertise.
                Front end developers are usually responsible for taking UX and UI deliverables and creating real working
                interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                The web used to be home to only websites. While the desktop hard drive was home to applications.
                In todays modern web, a web address may load a simple website or a full featured application without
                installing additional software.
                The user’s data and profile are all saved in “the cloud” and accessible on all their web enabled
                devices.
                A skilled front end web developer can build both websites and web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Responsive design allows web app interfaces to adapt to mobile screen sizes.
                However, it should be noted that web apps are not native mobile apps.
                Native mobile apps are downloaded, typically, from an app store or market.
                Mobile app developers create native apps.
                Front end web developers make responsive web apps that run in a mobile device’s web browser.
            </p>

            <h2>Recommended Background</h2>

            <p>
                No previous coding experience is required, however, those familiar with HTML, CSS or JavaScript will

            <h2>Is this course for me?</h2>
            <p>
                A few questions for you.
                Do you love solving problems?
                Are you constantly learning new things?
                Others say you’re detailed oriented and meticulous?
                Are you fascinated by the capabilities of web technologies and wish you could turn your ideas into reality?
                Yes?
                Read on.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you’re driven when challenged and prone to press on when others tend to give up, you might have the aptitude of a developer.
                Not taking this course could mean missing an opportunity to live the life you were perfectly designed for.
            </p>
